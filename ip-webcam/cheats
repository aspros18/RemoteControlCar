To enter cheat, open IP Webcam settings, press hardware menu key and select "Cheats". Cheats are made for advanced users and entered values often are not checked for validity, so use them on your own risk!

Options are set with set command and be reset to default value with reset command.

Examples:
set(Video,320,240)
reset(Photo)
set(Awake,true)

Commands not exposed to UI:

set(Photo,X,Y)
    Changes photo resolution to X*Y
set(Video,X,Y)

set(HtmlPath,/sdcard/html)
    Sets a path where web server searches for a web page before returning the builtin one. To override the main page name the file "index.html". Files should contain HTTP headers and an empty line after.

You can start the IP Webcam with the Android intent containing class com.pas.webcam.Rolling. You can optionally pass ArrayList named "cheats" for reconfiguring IP Webcam before starting the server. You can also change the text on buttons, hide them and modify their actions by passing proper extra fields. Download an example app
